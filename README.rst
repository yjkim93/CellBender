CellBender Downstream Analysis

This repository contains standalone Python code (extracted from the original CellBender repository) for performing downstream analysis on CellBender output.

The official package has strict dependency requirements (e.g., nbconvert < 7.0) that may conflict with some Python environments. To avoid these issues, the relevant downstream functions have been isolated and packaged here for easier use.
